# Rust Crossbreed Calculator

PICTURE HERE

Rust Crossbreed Calculator is a simple program that assists in the in-game crossbreed process. Rust features a crossbreeding system for adjusting the genes of plants. When done manually, this process is very time consuming. This program greatly sped up the process by calculating the resulting breed for you. Made using WPF, this program features a calculator, breed inspector, and crossbreed history.

At the time of release, this 2nd program of it's kind and the only one kept a list of createdbreeds, which allowed for much more practical use. It was also the only program at the time that allowed for multi-generation crossbreeding, as opposed to only having a single generation where you could not track how to produce a specific breed if you forgot.
