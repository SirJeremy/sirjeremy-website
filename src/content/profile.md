I am a programmer with a wide variety of talents with experience in programming, 3D modeling, game production, and web development. My wide knowledge base makes me a great pick for projects that incorporate many different technologies, allowing me a greater understanding of problems that may arise during integration.

Originally, I got my associate degree in game programming at Norco College, but through experience, I found that I enjoy "regular" programming more. Since then, I went back to school and got my bachelorâ€™s in computer science at Cal State San Bernardino, and now I am pursuing a career in software engineering.

I have experience working in teams and enjoy working with people. I find that the best work gets done when you collaborate with other people because the comingling of ideas and talents can create a far more robust result than people working independently towards the same goal. You only know what you know, and it is always fun to know what you didn't know.

In my free time, I enjoy building Gundams, trying out a variety of hot sauce, listening to music, playing video games, and watching anime. I also enjoy rhythm games, chess, exercising, politics, and longs walks on the beach.
